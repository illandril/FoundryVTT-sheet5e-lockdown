If there are features that you use from Illandril's Character Sheet Lockdown with Tidy5e Sheets that are not already implemented directly in Tidy5e Sheet, Illandril recommends you open an issue on the Tidy5e Sheet GitHub page to request those features be added directly in Tidy5e Sheet so you no longer need to rely on both modules working together: https://github.com/sdenec/tidy5e-sheet/issues\nIllandril's Character Sheet Lockdown will continue to suppor the default sheets and custom sheets that do not add as many features as Tidy5e Sheet even if Tidy5e Sheet suppport is dropped.\nIf you encounter issues with this module and Tidy5e Sheet, but don't want to fully disable this module because you use a mix of both standard and Tidy5e sheets, you can disable only the Tidy5e Sheet support. If you do encounter problems with this module (in Tidy5e sheets or elsewhere), please open an issue on this module's GitHub project page: https://github.com/illandril/FoundryVTT-sheet5e-lockdown - if the fix is simple enough, I will still fix it and keep Tidy5e Sheet support. I will only drop Tidy5e Sheet support if and when a substantial enough issue comes along that would require too much effort to fix for me to consider it worthwhile."
