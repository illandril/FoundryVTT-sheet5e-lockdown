## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/illandril/FoundryVTT-sheet5e-lockdown/releases/tag/v2.0.0) (2020-09-18)
**New Features:**
* [\#5](https://github.com/illandril/FoundryVTT-sheet5e-lockdown/issues/5) (BETA) Adds support for the Tidy5e Sheets. This has not been fully tested, and may have issues - if you use Tidy5e and encounter issues, please let me know by opening an issue - I am unlikely to notice on my own, as I do not use Tidy5e sheets myself.
* [\#4](https://github.com/illandril/FoundryVTT-sheet5e-lockdown/issues/4) Adds configuration options to control how much or how little players can edit.
