This is a module for the the D&D 5e System for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that prevents players from making changes to aspects of their character sheets that should change infrequently, and provides the option to completely hide some elements that you don't want to use at all. Settings are available to customize exactly what is locked / hidden, and determine who has permission to make sheets editable through a toggle button.

Note that this is not a secure lockdown and players could get around the restrictions, so this is not a sufficient answer if your players are malicious. This is intended for games where the players are inexperienced (with D&D and/or with using computers) to prevent them from making mistakes (ex. accidentally adding/removing saving throw proficiency).

If you have any requests (including support for a specific custom character sheet), please write an issue here with details on what you are looking for.

# Character Sheet Lockdown for other Systems

If you would like this behavior for other Systems, feel free to write an issue and I will consider it. My time is limited, and character sheets for systems vary considerably, so do not be surprised if I either take a long time to create a module for your preferred system, or don't create one at all. If you know of any other modules that already provide similar behavior for other systems, please let me know so I can link to them here for others who might be interested in that behavior.
