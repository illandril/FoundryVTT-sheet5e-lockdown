# Illandril's Character Sheet Lockdown (5e)
This is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that prevents players from making changes to aspects of their character sheets that should change infrequently, and provides the option to completely hide some elements that you don't want to use at all. Settings are available to customize exactly what is locked / hidden, and determine who has permission to make sheets editable through a toggle button.

Note that this is not a secure lockdown and players could get around the restrictions, so this is not a sufficient answer if your players are malicious. This is intended for games where the players are inexperienced (with D&D and/or with using computers) to prevent them from making mistakes (ex. accidentally adding/removing saving throw proficiency).

If you have any requests (including support for a specific custom character sheet), please write an issue here with details on what you are looking for.
