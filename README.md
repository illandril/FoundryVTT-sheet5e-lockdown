# Illandril's Character Sheet Lockdown (5e)
This is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that prevents players from making changes to aspects of their character sheets that should change infrequently.

It also completely hides the Background and Alignment inputs, the Currency Conversion button, and the Biography tab.

Note that this is not a secure lockdown and players could get around the restrictions, so this is not a sufficient answer if your players are malicious. This is intended for games where the players are inexperienced (with D&D and/or with using computers) to prevent them from making mistakes (ex. accidentally adding/removing saving throw proficiency).

The following are still editable to players...
1. Current, +Temp, and +Max Hit Points
1. Short/Long Rest Buttons
1. Available Resource 1/2/3
1. Death Saves
1. Exhaustion
1. Inspiration
1. Feature Available Uses
1. Available Spell Slots

The GM can turn on editing for themselves through a Toggle Edit button in the character sheet title bar.
